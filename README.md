<H1 align="center">Applying 2D Convolutional Layer and 2D Transpose Convolutional Layer</H1>

- In this repository I will be sucessfully implementing 2d convolutional layer and 2d Transpose Convolutional Layer with discriminator and generator function in it.
1. First of all I have imported the required libraries for this implementation.
2. Then I have made two classes one each for 2d convolutional layer and 2d transpose convolutional layer with discriminator and generator function respectively.
3. I have also made five layers in both classes.
4. I pass a tensor of input dimensions and it is outputing a tensor of dimensions described in the images attached below.
5.
